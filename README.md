---

ductor runs on your machine, uses your existing Claude or Codex subscription, and remembers who you are between conversations. One Markdown file is the agent's memory. One folder (`~/.ductor/`) holds everything. `pipx install ductor`, done.

You can schedule cron jobs, set up webhooks, and let the agent check in on its own with heartbeat prompts. Responses stream live into Telegram. Sessions survive restarts.

## Quick start

```bash
pipx install ductor
ductor
```

The setup wizard walks you through the rest.

## Why ductor?

I tried a bunch of CLI wrappers and Telegram bots for Claude and Codex. Most were either too complex to set up, too hard to modify, or got people banned because they spoofed headers and forged API requests to impersonate the official CLI.

ductor doesn't do that.

- Spawns the real CLI binary as a subprocess. No token interception, no request forging
- Uses only official rule files: `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md`
- Memory is one Markdown file. No RAG, no vector stores
- One channel (Telegram), one Python package, one command

The agents are good enough now that you can steer them through their own rule files. I don't need a RAG system to store memories -a single Markdown file that tracks what I like, what I don't, and what I'm working on is plenty. I can reach them from Telegram instead of a terminal.

I picked Python because it's easy to modify. The agents can write their own automations, receive webhooks (new email? parse it and ping me), set up scheduled tasks. All controlled from your phone.

## Features

### Core

- Responses stream in real-time -ductor edits the Telegram message live as text arrives
- Switch between Claude Code, Codex, and Gemini mid-conversation with `/model`
- Sessions survive bot restarts
- `@opus` or `@flash` temporarily switches model without changing your default
- Send images, PDFs, voice messages, or videos -ductor routes them to the right tool
- Agents can send `[button:Yes]` `[button:No]` inline keyboards back to you
- Persistent memory across sessions, stored in one Markdown file

### Automation

- **Cron jobs** -recurring tasks with cron expressions and timezone support. Each job runs as its own subagent with a dedicated workspace and memory file (plus optional per-job quiet hours and dependency locks)
- **Webhooks** -HTTP endpoints with Bearer or HMAC auth. Two modes: *wake* injects a prompt into your active chat, *cron_task* runs a separate task session. Works with GitHub, Stripe, or anything that sends POST
- **Heartbeat** -the agent checks in periodically during active sessions. Quiet hours respected
- **Cleanup** -daily retention cleanup for `telegram_files/` and `output_to_user/`

#### Example: a cron job

Tell the agent: "Check Hacker News every morning at 8 and send me the top AI stories."

ductor creates a task folder with everything the subagent needs:

```
~/.ductor/workspace/cron_tasks/hn-ai-digest/
    CLAUDE.md              # Agent rules (managed by ductor)
    AGENTS.md              # Same rules for Codex
    TASK_DESCRIPTION.md    # What the agent should do
    hn-ai-digest_MEMORY.md # The subagent's own memory across runs
    scripts/               # Helper scripts if needed
```

At 8:00 every morning, ductor starts a fresh session in that folder. The subagent reads the task, does the work, writes what it learned to memory, and posts the result to your chat. It is context-isolated from your main conversation and memory.

#### Example: a webhook wake call

Your CI fails. A webhook in *wake* mode injects the payload into your active chat. Your agent sees it with full history and memory and responds.

```
POST /hooks/ci-failure -> "CI failed on branch main: test_auth.py::test_login timed out"
-> Agent reads this, checks the code, tells you what went wrong
```

### Infrastructure

- `ductor service install` -Linux systemd user service (start on boot, restart on crash)
- Docker sandbox image (built via `Dockerfile.sandbox`) -both CLIs have full filesystem access by default, so a container keeps your host safe
- `/upgrade` checks PyPI, offers in-chat upgrade, then restarts automatically on success
- Supervisor with PID lock. Exit code 42 triggers restart
- Prompt injection detection, path traversal checks, per-user allowlist

### Developer experience

- First-run wizard detects your CLIs, walks through config, seeds the workspace
- New config fields merge automatically on upgrade
- `/diagnose` shows system diagnostics (version/provider/model, Codex cache status, recent logs), `/status` shows session stats
- `/stop` terminates the active run and drains queued messages, `/new` starts a fresh session
- `/showfiles` lets you browse `~/.ductor/` as a clickable file tree inside Telegram
- Messages sent while the agent is working show `[Message in queue...]` with a cancel button
- Bundled skills (e.g. `skill-creator`) are symlinked into the workspace and stay current with the installed version

## How it works

```
You (Telegram)
    |
    v
ductor (aiogram)
    |
    ├── AuthMiddleware (user allowlist)
    ├── SequentialMiddleware (per-chat lock + queue tracking)
    |
    v
Orchestrator
    |
    ├── Command Router (/new, /model, /stop, ...)
    ├── Message Flow -> CLIService -> claude / codex / gemini subprocess
    ├── CronObserver -> Scheduled task execution
    ├── HeartbeatObserver -> Periodic background checks
    ├── WebhookObserver -> HTTP endpoint server
    ├── CleanupObserver -> Daily file retention cleanup
    └── UpdateObserver -> PyPI version check
    |
    v
Streamed response -> Live-edited Telegram message
```

ductor spawns the CLI as a child process and parses its streaming output. The Telegram message gets edited live as text arrives. Sessions are stored as JSON. Background systems run as asyncio tasks in the same process.

## Workspace

Everything lives in `~/.ductor/`.

```
~/.ductor/
    config/config.json           # Bot config (token, user IDs, model, Docker, timezone)
    sessions.json                # Active sessions per chat
    cron_jobs.json               # Scheduled task definitions
    webhooks.json                # Webhook endpoint definitions
    CLAUDE.md                    # Agent rules (auto-synced)
    AGENTS.md                    # Same rules for Codex (auto-synced)
    GEMINI.md                    # Same rules for Gemini (auto-synced)
    logs/agent.log               # Rotating log file
    workspace/
        memory_system/
            MAINMEMORY.md        # The agent's long-term memory about you
        cron_tasks/              # One subfolder per scheduled job
        skills/
            skill-creator/       # Bundled skill (symlinked from package)
        tools/
            cron_tools/          # Add, edit, remove, list cron jobs
            webhook_tools/       # Add, edit, remove, test webhooks
            telegram_tools/      # Process files, transcribe audio, read PDFs
            user_tools/          # Custom scripts the agent builds for you
        telegram_files/          # Downloaded media, organized by date
        output_to_user/          # Files the agent sends back to you
```

Plain text, JSON, and Markdown. No databases, no binary formats.

## Configuration

Config lives in `~/.ductor/config/config.json`. The wizard creates it on first run:

```bash
ductor  # wizard creates config interactively
```

Key fields: `telegram_token`, `allowed_user_ids`, `provider` (claude or codex), `model`, `docker.enabled`, `user_timezone`, `cleanup`. Full schema in [docs/config.md](https://github.com/PleasePrompto/ductor/blob/main/docs/config.md).

#### CLI Parameters

Configure provider-specific CLI parameters in `config.json`:

```json
{
  "cli_parameters": {
    "claude": [],
    "codex": ["--chrome"],
    "gemini": []
  }
}
```

Parameters are appended to CLI commands for the respective provider.

#### Advanced Cron Task Configuration

Cron tasks support per-task execution overrides:

```json
{
  "provider": "codex",
  "model": "gpt-5.2-codex",
  "reasoning_effort": "high",
  "cli_parameters": ["--chrome"],
  "quiet_start": 22,
  "quiet_end": 7,
  "dependency": "nightly-reports"
}
```

All fields are optional and fall back to global config values if not specified.

ductor runs the official CLI binaries from Anthropic, OpenAI, and Google. It does not modify API calls, spoof headers, forge tokens, or impersonate clients. Every request comes from the real CLI process.

Terms of Service can change. Automating CLI interactions may be a gray area depending on how providers interpret their rules. We built ductor to follow intended usage patterns, but can't guarantee it won't lead to account restrictions.
